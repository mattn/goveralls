goveralls
=========

[Go](http://golang.org) integration for [Coveralls.io](http://coveralls.io)
continuous code coverage tracking system.

# Installation

`goveralls` requires a working Go installation (Go1 or higher).

```bash
$ go get github.com/mattn/goveralls
```


# Usage

First you will need an API token.  It is found at the bottom of your
repository's page when you are logged in to Coveralls.io.  Each repo has its
own token.

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourusername/yourpackage
$ goveralls $TOKEN
```

# Continuous Integration

## Travis CI

`goveralls` currently cannot be used with Travis.  This may change when Go 1.1 is released.


## Drone.io

Store your Coveralls API token in `Enviornment Variables`:

```
COVERALLS_TOKEN=your_token_goes_here
```

Append these lines to your `Commands`:

```
go get github.com/axw/gocov/gocov
go get github.com/mattn/goveralls
goveralls -service drone.io $COVERALLS_TOKEN
```
